# Introduction
This project aims to explore the possibility of predicting the winning team of the English Premier League (EPL) 22/23 season using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical match data from the 21/22 season, the project seeks to understand patterns and factors that contribute to a team's success.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project comprises all EPL matches from the 21/22 season. It includes various features that capture the dynamics of the games and the performance of the teams.

# Methodology
The project employs a Logistic Regression algorithm to model the relationship between the features and the target variable, which represents the winning team. The model is trained on the 21/22 season data and tested on the 22/23 season.

# Results
The results of the project are promising, with a successful prediction of the winning team for the EPL 22/23 season. The model's performance highlights the potential of machine learning in sports analytics and prediction.
